This is just a simple C# application to let me cheat at Minesweeper. With Minesweeper already running, simply double-click on the form to read the winmine.exe process' memory and you'll get a little grid showing you the locations of the mines.

This works with the Windows XP version due to hardcoded memory locations.

Credit to http://sunshine2k.de/reversing.html for the original idea. He did the same thing a decade ago and wrote his cheater in VC++. I decided to do the same in C#.
