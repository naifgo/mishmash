# Exercises
Just random nibbles and bits: coding exercises, mini projects, kata, etc

- picalc.cpp: Learning about floating point number precision by calculating pi. I needed, and got, some great help on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cplusplus/comments/27yd9v/help_with_pi_and_limitations_on_c_and_x64).
- picalc_disasm.txt: A disassembly used to help figure out some results that seemed funky. Follow along in the reddit thread.

-recurscalc.cpp: Just playing with matrices.
