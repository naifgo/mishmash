# Exercises
Just random nibbles and bits: coding exercises, mini projects, kata, etc. Most of the code is GPLv3 or Public Domain (where allowed by law). Some of these things were done quite a long time ago so it's possible I followed a tutorial or something. If you notice any code that bears a striking resemblance to someone else's, please let me know (submit an issue or pull request) so I can give credit where it is due and/or update the license appropriately.
