# Exercises

Just random nibbles and bits: coding exercises, mini projects, kata, etc. Most of the code is GPLv3, MIT or Public Domain. See each individual source file for licensing and a basic explanation of its purpose. I'll also link to sources and references I recall using.

I did my best to Google on some key functions, variables, etc, to make sure I'm not just brain-farting and didn't actually write the code myself. Some of these were just dug up while cleaning out a few old drives and I figured I'd save them.

If you notice any code that bears a striking resemblance to someone else's, please let me know so I can give credit where it is due and/or update the license appropriately.
