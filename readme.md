# MishMash

This repo is just random nibbles and bits: coding exercises, mini projects, kata, etc. A lot of the code is simplistic enough that copyright is meaningless but assume GPLv3 unless marked otherwise. See each individual source file for licensing information and/or links to sources and references used.

Some of these things were just laying around in the home directories of various old hard drives. I wanted to keep them around since I find value in hopping into old projects, especially that are poorly documented, and attempting to understand them and sometimes continue with them. If I forgot a reference, just post an issue here so I can give credit and/or update the license appropriately.
